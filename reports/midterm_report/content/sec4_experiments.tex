\section{Experiments}
We revised the implementations that will be adopted:  \cite{Node2VecImpl} for Node2Vec, \cite{LINEImpl} for LINE, \cite{DVNEImpl} for DVNE, \cite{GraphSageImpl} for GraphSage. 
Depending on our specific needs, some of these could be modified or used as an inspiration for our own implementations. \\ \newline 
Following some initial experiments, we decided to use the DEI cluster "Blade" as hardware for the computation of the larger graphs.
The specifications for the nodes of the cluster are available in the open documentation \cite{ClusterDEI}.
More information about the project's memory usage and runtime will be available in the final report. \\
