To evaluate the methods used in this project, two different evaluation measures will be used: the Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic curve (AUROC), and the Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR).
AUROC is historically considered the primary performance metric used to evaluate the performances of Link Prediction methods \cite{Kalyani2025}. 
However, AUROC favors accurate classification of positive examples, at the cost of misclassifying the negative ones.
In a scenario like Link Prediction problem, which is inherently skewed towards the negative class, it may not be suitable and can 
overestimate the performance of the methods. 
For this reason, the AUPR curve was also selected, as it can provide better evaluation of Link Prediction in the presence of class imbalance.
