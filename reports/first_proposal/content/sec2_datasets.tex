\section{Datasets}
The datasets that will be used in this project are nine and they are divided into three categories: Road Networks, Social Networks, and Biological Networks.
For each of these categories, three datasets of increasing size were chosen: one small, one medium, and one large. \\
The datasets, with their main properties (number of nodes, number of edges, and type of graph), are reported in Table \ref{tab:datasets}.
