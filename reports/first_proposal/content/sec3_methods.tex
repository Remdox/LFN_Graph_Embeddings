Node embedding is the task of mapping nodes into an embedding space, where each node \(v\) is represented by a vector \(\mathbf{z_v} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) using the mapping function \(ENC: v \to \mathbf{z}_v\).
The encoding of nodes into embeddings has to be such that similarity between each pair of nodes is kept in the correspondent embeddings. 
In order to achieve this, a similarity score \(S(u, v)\) is computed between pairwise nodes and a decoder function 
\(DEC: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) is used for computing a similarity score for the embeddings. The discrepancy between the two scores is then compared and minimized 
by means of a loss function, such as the empirical loss:
\[ \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j} \ell(DEC(\mathbf{z}_u, \mathbf{z}_v), S(u, v)) \]
Based on this context, the specifics of which encoder and decoder is used is what really differentiates the node embedding methods. 
In this project, four node embedding methods will be employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Node2Vec, a shallow encoding which is a tunable version of the DeepWalk algorithm, which is often used in the scientific literature as the baseline for comparing node embedding methods.
    \item LINE, a shallow encoding which is am highly-scalable approximation algorithm.
    \item Deep Variational Network Embedding in Wasserstein Space, a deep encoding method using a Variational Autoencoder. This metod has a particular approach of
          encoding each node to a probability distribution, so in this case the similarity score between embeddings is a distance between probability distributions, which
          can be measured using the Wasserstein distance.
    \item GraphSage, a deep encoding method making use of a GNN that aggregates the features of each node's neighborhood and learns to generate node embeddings from that.
\end{itemize}
Given the graph embeddings, we use them as input to ML models to make predictions, depending on the task to solve.
In the case of this project and the datasets used, the main task is link prediction. Link prediction is the problem of predicting a link between two nodes in a network.
The models that will be used for solving the task are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support Vector Machines
    \item Random Forest
    \item Multilayer Perceptron
\end{itemize}
